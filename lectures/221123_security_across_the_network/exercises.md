## Not Promgramming Task
Create a diagram for your solution to A4. This should show each of the different processes/threads and how they communicate with each other. Identify any points of deadlock present and then either justfiy why they won't occur, or redesign your solution. You may find your design is deadlock free, in which case justify this asssessment. 

Make a note of any shared variables between different processes/threads and determine if any race conditions will occur. If so, alter your design to account for this either my managing access to those variables or not sharing them at all.

As a note, this is the sort of thing that looks very nice in a report, along with any discussion relating to it.
